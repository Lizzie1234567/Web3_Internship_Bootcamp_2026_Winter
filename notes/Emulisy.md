# Blockchain Basics

## 1\. What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology used to record information securely, transparently, and immutably across multiple participants. It consists of a series of chronologically linked “blocks,” each containing transaction data and the hash of the previous block, ensuring the integrity of the chain.

### Key Features of Blockchain

\- **Immutable**: Once data is written to the chain, it is nearly impossible to alter  
\- **transparen**t: Transactions on the chain are visible to everyone  
\- **Decentralized**: No central authority; the network is maintained by multiple nodes  
\- **Fast Settlement**: Cross-border transactions can be confirmed quickly without banks

Nodes collaborate through a distributed network to maintain the ledger, improving the system’s resistance to interference and trustworthiness.

## 2\. Web3 vs Web2

\- **Web2**: User data and content are controlled by centralized companies  
\- **Web3**: Built on blockchain, emphasizing decentralization and giving users more control and privacy

Core principles of Web3:  
\- Decentralization  
\- Open protocols  
\- User-owned data  
\- Trustworthy cross-platform interactions
